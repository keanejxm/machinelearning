[{"url":"http://minimum-entropy.districtdatalabs.com/api/answers/6/?format=json","text":"I've been converting many of my old projects (\"phoenixing them as @llorenz might say) to Python 3 and the very first question I'd ask is:\r\n\r\n- Is Python 2 backwards compatibility required? \r\n\r\nIf so, then you have a bit different of a challenge, and my primary suggestion is to make the code 2.7 and 3.4+ compatible. I've made great use of the [six](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six) and [future](http://python-future.org/)  libraries to achieve this. The `future` library is especially useful since it has a [cheat sheet](http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html) of Python 2-3 compatible idioms when using future, and can point you in the right direction for `six`. \r\n\r\nIf Python 2 compatibility is _not_ required - then you can save yourself a lot of effort, and I recommend going this direction with your programs if possible. \r\n\r\nSo if you learned and write decent Python _2.7_ code, I've found that it isn't very difficult to transition to Python 3. I usually go about this by first checking out a Python 3 branch and creating the virtual environment:\r\n\r\n    $ git branch -b python3\r\n    $ virtualenv -p python3 venvpy3\r\n    $ source venvpy3/bin/activate \r\n    (venvpy3) $ pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n\r\nThis is a great first start because you'll discover that many of your direct dependencies have fewer sub-dependencies or may have different versions. It will also tell you if any module you use is not Python 3 compatible (though I've never encountered this). \r\n\r\nFrom there I simply run my tests and scripts and locate errors. The most common stuff for me are the following global replacements:\r\n\r\n- `print` &rarr; `print()` \r\n- `xrange` &rarr; `range`\r\n- `iteritems` &rarr; `items`\r\n- `basestring` &rarr; `str` \r\n- `u\"\"` &rarr; `\"\"` \r\n- `hashlib.sha1(text)` &rarr; `hashlib.sha1(text.encode('utf-8'))` \r\n- `from cStringIO import StringIO` &rarr; `from io import StringIO` \r\n- `float(num) / float(div)` &rarr; `num / div` \r\n\r\nMany other errors are pretty easily Googleable via \"Python 3 [ERROR MESSAGE]\". \r\n\r\nSome other common gotchas include:\r\n\r\n- Imports \r\n- Dictionary comprehensions \r\n- Strings and bytes \r\n- New style class extension \r\n\r\nThe one that really bugs me is the `version` argument in `argparse`, but that's just one of the minor trivialities you have to deal with. \r\n\r\nFor the most part, I've converted many of my old projects in just a few hours!","text_rendered":"<p>I've been converting many of my old projects (\"phoenixing them as @llorenz might say) to Python 3 and the very first question I'd ask is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is Python 2 backwards compatibility required? </li>\n</ul>\n<p>If so, then you have a bit different of a challenge, and my primary suggestion is to make the code 2.7 and 3.4+ compatible.
