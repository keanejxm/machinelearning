We've collected some definitions of some common NLP and ML acronyms and terminology here.footnote:[Bill Wilson at the university of New South Wales in Australia has a more complete one here: https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~billw/nlpdict.html]
You can find some of the tools we used to generate this list in the `nlpia` python package at https://github.com/totalgood/nlpia/blob/master/src/nlpia/transcoders.py[github.com/totalgood/nlpia]].

>>> len(translate_book(book_dir=BOOK_PATH, dest='cleaned_hyperlinks'))
>>> from nlpia.loaders import get_data
>>> wv = get_data('word2vec')
>>> np.linalg.norm(wv['Illinois'] - wv['Illini'])  # <1>
>>> np.linalg.norm(another.wv['Illinois'])

This looks a little like a hyperlink, but it's not: np.linalg.norm(wv['Illinois'] - wv['Illini']).

*Morphemes*:: Parts of tokens or words that contain meaning in and of themselves. The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheme[morphemes] that make up a token are collectively called its _morphology_ which can be found using algorithms in packages like https://spacy.io[SpaCy]. footnote:[https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#rule-based-morphology]
