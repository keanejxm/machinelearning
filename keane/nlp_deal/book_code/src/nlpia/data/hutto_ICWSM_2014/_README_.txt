2. vader_sentiment_lexicon.txt
       Empirically validated by multiple independent human judges, VADER incorporates a
    "gold-standard" sentiment lexicon that is especially attuned to microblog-like contexts. 
    The VADER sentiment lexicon is sensitive both the polarity and the intensity of sentiments 
	expressed in social media contexts, and is also generally applicable to sentiment analysis 
	in other domains.
	   Manually creating (much less, validating) a comprehensive sentiment lexicon is 
	a labor intensive and sometimes error prone process, so it is no wonder that many 
	opinion mining researchers and practitioners rely so heavily on existing lexicons 
	as primary resources. We are pleased to offer ours as a new resource.
	   We begin by constructing a list inspired by examining existing well-established 
	sentiment word-banks (LIWC, ANEW, and GI). To this, we next incorporate numerous 
	lexical features common to sentiment expression in microblogs, including 
	 - a full list of Western-style emoticons, for example, :-) denotes a smiley face 
	   and generally indicates positive sentiment)
	 - sentiment-related acronyms and initialisms (e.g., LOL and WTF are both examples of 
	   sentiment-laden initialisms)
	 - commonly used slang with sentiment value (e.g., nah, meh and giggly). 
	This process provided us with over 9,000 lexical feature candidates. Next, we assessed 
	the general applicability of each feature candidate to sentiment expressions. We 
	used a wisdom-of-the-crowd13 (WotC) approach (Surowiecki, 2004) to acquire a valid 
	point estimate for the sentiment valence (intensity) of each context-free candidate 
	feature. We collected intensity ratings on each of our candidate lexical features 
	from ten independent human raters (for a total of 90,000+ ratings). Features were 
	rated on a scale from "[–4] Extremely Negative" to "[4] Extremely Positive", with 
	allowance for "[0] Neutral (or Neither, N/A)". 
	   We kept every lexical feature that had a non-zero mean rating, and whose standard 
	deviation was less than 2.5 as determined by the aggregate of ten independent raters. 
	This left us with just over 7,500 lexical features with validated valence scores that 
	indicated both the sentiment polarity (positive/negative), and the sentiment intensity 
	on a scale from –4 to +4. For example, the word "okay" has a positive valence of 0.9, 
	"good" is 1.9, and "great" is 3.1, whereas "horrible" is –2.5, the frowning emoticon :( 
	is –2.2, and "sucks" and it's slang derivative "sux" are both –1.5. 
3. vaderSentiment.py
    The Python code for the rule-based sentiment analysis engine. Implements the 
	grammatical and syntactical rules described in the paper, incorporating empirically 
	derived quantifications for the impact of each rule on the perceived intensity of 
	sentiment in sentence-level text. Importantly, these heuristics go beyond what would 
	normally be captured in a typical bag-of-words model. They incorporate **word-order 
	sensitive relationships** between terms. For example, degree modifiers (also called 
	intensifiers, booster words, or degree adverbs) impact sentiment intensity by either 
	increasing or decreasing the intensity. Consider these examples:
	   (a) "The service here is extremely good" 
	   (b) "The service here is good"
	   (c) "The service here is marginally good"
	From Table 3 in the paper, we see that for 95% of the data, using a degree modifier
    increases the positive sentiment intensity of example (a) by 0.227 to 0.36, with a 
	mean difference of 0.293 on a rating scale from 1 to 4. Likewise, example (c) reduces 
	the perceived sentiment intensity by 0.293, on average.

DATASETS AND TESTING RESOURCES:
4. tweets_GroundTruth.txt
	FORMAT: the file is tab delimited with ID, MEAN-SENTIMENT-RATING, and TWEET-TEXT
    DESCRIPTION: includes "tweet-like" text as inspired by 4,000 tweets pulled from Twitter’s public timeline, plus 200 completely contrived tweet-like texts intended to specifically test syntactical and grammatical conventions of conveying differences in sentiment intensity. The "tweet-like" texts incorporate a fictitious username (@anonymous) in places where a username might typically appear, along with a fake URL ( http://url_removed ) in places where a URL might typically appear, as inspired by the original tweets. The ID and MEAN-SENTIMENT-RATING correspond to the raw sentiment rating data provided in 'tweets_anonDataRatings.txt' (described below).
5. tweets_anonDataRatings.txt
    FORMAT: the file is tab delimited with ID, MEAN-SENTIMENT-RATING, STANDARD DEVIATION, and RAW-SENTIMENT-RATINGS
	DESCRIPTION: Sentiment ratings from a minimum of 20 independent human raters (all pre-screened, trained, and quality checked for optimal inter-rater reliability).
6. nytEditorialSnippets_GroundTruth.txt
	FORMAT: the file is tab delimited with ID, MEAN-SENTIMENT-RATING, and TEXT-SNIPPET
    DESCRIPTION: includes 5,190 sentence-level snippets from 500 New York Times opinion news editorials/articles; we used the NLTK tokenizer to segment the articles into sentence phrases, and added sentiment intensity ratings. The ID and MEAN-SENTIMENT-RATING correspond to the raw sentiment rating data provided in 'nytEditorialSnippets_anonDataRatings.txt' (described below).
7. nytEditorialSnippets_anonDataRatings.txt

The snippets were derived from an original set of 2000 movie reviews (1000 positive and 1000 negative) in Pang & Lee (2004); we used the NLTK tokenizer to segment the reviews into sentence phrases, and added sentiment intensity ratings. The ID and MEAN-SENTIMENT-RATING correspond to the raw sentiment rating data provided in 'movieReviewSnippets_anonDataRatings.txt' (described below).
